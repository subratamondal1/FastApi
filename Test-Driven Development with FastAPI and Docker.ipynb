    "### App Overview\n",
    "By the end of this course, you will have built an asynchronous text summarization API with Test-Driven Development. The API itself will follow RESTful design principles, using the basic HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with Python and FastAPI, we'll use Docker to quickly set up our local development environment and simplify deployment. Tortoise ORM, an async ORM (Object Relational Mapper), will be used to interact with a Postgres database. We'll use pytest instead of unittest for writing unit and integration tests to test the API. Finally, we'll store the code on a GitHub repository and utilize GitHub Actions to run tests before deploying to Heroku.\n",

    "### FastAPI\n",
    "While Flask and Django are the two most popular Python web frameworks, FastAPI has surged in popularity since 2019 since it supports async out-of-the box and has an advanced data validation feature based on Python type hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, FastAPI is a modern, batteries-included Python web framework that's perfect for building RESTful APIs. It can handle both synchronous and asynchronous requests and has built-in support for data validation, JSON serialization, authentication and authorization, and OpenAPI (version 3.0.2 as of writing) documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heavily inspired by Flask, it has a lightweight microframework feel with support for Flask-like route decorators.\n",
    "2. It takes advantage of Python type hints for parameter declaration which enables data validation (via pydantic) and OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.\n",
    "3. Built on top of Starlette, it supports the development of asynchronous APIs.\n",
    "4. It's fast. Since async is much more efficient than the traditional synchronous threading model, it can compete with Node and Go with regards to performance.\n",
    "5. Because it's based on and fully compatible with OpenAPI and JSON Schema, it supports a number of powerful tools, like Swagger UI.\n",
    "6. It has amazing documentation.\n"

    "1. Requires less boilerplate code so your test suites will be more readable.\n",
    "2. Supports the plain assert statement, which is far more readable and easier to remember compared to the assertSomething methods -- like assertEquals, assertTrue, and assertContains -- in unittest.\n",
    "3. Is updated more frequently since it's not part of the Python standard library.\n",
    "4. Simplifies setting up and tearing down test state with its fixture system.\n",

On the one hand, it does take a bit more to serve up the app in development mode.
